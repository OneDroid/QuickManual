## QuickManual

**QuickManual** is a **free and open-source Chrome & Firefox extension** that drastically simplifies adding **manual time entries in Monitask**.

If you frequently go inactive due to meetings, testing, or non-trackable work, QuickManual saves you from manually entering start and end times one by one.

-------

## Problem It Solves

When Monitask marks time as inactive, users must:
- Open manual request form
- Manually enter start time
- Manually enter end time
- Repeat this process multiple times daily

This is slow, repetitive, and frustrating.

**QuickManual eliminates this friction.**

## Solution

QuickManual adds a smart **“Add Manual”** button directly to inactive time blocks on the **Monitask Timeline**, automatically filling the start and end times for you.

One hover. One click. Done.
